    "category": "Growth",
    "content": "[George Bonaci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/georgebonaci/) is the VP of Growth & Demand at [Ramp](http://ramp.com/).\n\n## Philosophy: Growth as Science\n\n- **Growth = Science**: Playbooks rarely transfer 1:1. Start with a blank slate — form a hypothesis → run experiments. Most marketers apply what they already know; real growth is discovering what works for your company.\n- **Mindset**: Think like a scientist — experimental design, measurement, and rigor.\n- **Velocity > Perfection**: Bias toward running more experiments faster vs. perfecting one.\n  - **The tradeoff**: A scrappy experiment that 3x's a conversion rate to hit the quarter is fine. Later, tighten rigor to understand causality. Velocity and rigor are dials based on time horizon.\n\n## Portfolio Approach\n\n- Treat growth like a VC portfolio with intentional allocation.\n  - **Long‑term (big swings)**: High‑risk, high‑reward — step‑changes. Most will fail.\n  - **Short‑term (incremental)**: Higher‑confidence 2–5% gains that help you hit this quarter.\n- **When a bet works → push to saturation**: Don't just 2–3x spend. Scale the channel quickly to its asymptote and find where the response curve decays. Most teams scale winners too slowly.\n\n![Diminishing-returns response curve for media investment → incremental sales.](https://slelguoygbfzlpylpxfs.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/document-uploads/image-1-1758998845345.png)\n\n- **Finding Alpha: Iterate + Experiment**\n\n    1. **Do what's new**: Be early where the channel is under‑priced or novel (e.g., first B2B brand on TikTok).\n    2. **Do what's contrarian**: Try what \"shouldn't\" work (e.g., Direct Mail becoming a major channel).\n\n## Mental Models\n\n- **Pre‑mortems & Post‑mortems**\n  - The value of a post‑mortem depends on the quality of the pre‑mortem.\n  - **Pre‑mortem**: Part of initial design — enumerate not just 3–4 big risks but the many small failure modes; assign probabilities.\n  - **The real learning = unpredicted failures**: When something fails for a reason you didn't anticipate, it reveals a flawed assumption in your model of the world.\n    - Predicted failures mostly confirm existing beliefs; limited learning.\n    - Investigate the surprise, update the model, and generalize the lesson across future experiments.\n  - **Key post‑mortem question**: \"Did we learn something we can generalize to other parts of the business?\"\n",
